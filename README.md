# Machine Learning Practice üß†üìä

Welcome to my Machine Learning Practice repository! This repo contains a collection of projects, experiments, and practice notebooks I'm working on as part of my journey to become a better data scientist.

## üß≠ About

This repository is where I explore various machine learning techniques, tools, and workflows ranging from foundational algorithms to advanced model optimization and feature engineering. Each notebook or script focuses on a specific concept or dataset to help reinforce key ideas in machine learning.

## üìÅ Contents

Some of the areas covered include:

- Supervised Learning
  - Classification (e.g Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests)
  - Regression (e.g Linear Regression, XGBoost)
- Unsupervised Learning
  - Clustering (e.g KMeans, DBSCAN)
  - Dimensionality Reduction (e.g PCA)
- Feature Engineering and Selection
- Model Evaluation & Cross-Validation
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handling Imbalanced Datasets
- Real-world dataset applications (e.g healthcare, finance)

## üîß Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, Numpy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- XGBoost, LightGBM
- Jupyter Notebooks

## üìå Purpose

This repo serves as:-

- A learning journal for my machine learning journey.
- A showcase of practical applications of ML concepts.
- A reference for future personal and collaborative projects.  

## üöÄ Still Learning

I'm currently focused on:

- Advanced Machine Learning techniques  
- Feature engineering and model interpretability  
- Exploring computational biology & bioinformatics use cases  
- Preparing to dive into Deep Learning soon
